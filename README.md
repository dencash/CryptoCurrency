# CryptoCurrency

The purpose of this project is to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they can be grouped to create a classification system. Since there is no output model, unsupervised machine learning will be used. The clustering algroithm will be used to group the cryptocurrencies, and visualization will be used for ease of analysis and to review findings within the project.
